# Contributing to CrossBan

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CrossBan! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to this open-source Discord bot project.

## Code of Conduct

We follow a simple code of conduct: Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive in all interactions. Harassment, discriminatory behavior, and political discussions will not be tolerated.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the [CrossBan repository](https://github.com/The-LukeZ/CrossBan) on GitHub.

2. **Create a Branch**: Work on a new branch for your changes (e.g., `feature/new-feature` or `bugfix/issue-fix`).

3. **Make Changes**: Ensure your code adheres to the project's standards (see below).

4. **Test Your Changes**: Run tests and verify functionality. CrossBan uses TypeScript, PostgreSQL 17, and is Dockerizedâ€”refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/The-LukeZ/CrossBan/wiki) for setup.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a PR with a clear description of your changes. Reference any related issues.

6. **Review Process**: Maintainers will review your PR. Be open to feedback and make necessary revisions.

## Development Setup

- Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the [Wiki](https://github.com/The-LukeZ/CrossBan/wiki).
- Use Node.js and Docker for local development, as well as pnpm for package management.
- Ensure PostgreSQL 17 is running via Docker.

## Coding Standards

- Write code in TypeScript.
- Follow standard JavaScript/TypeScript conventions (Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting).

  - You can run `pnpm format` to format your code with prettier. It uses the configuration in [`.prettierrc`](/.prettierrc).
  - Always use Components V2 - only use embeds where necessary (because of authors/headers/fields).

- Use meaningful commit messages. (e.g., `feat: add <new feature>`, `fix: resolve issue #123`).
- Keep code modular and well-documented. (Use JSDoc comments where appropriate).

## Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or suggest features.
- Provide detailed steps to reproduce bugs, including environment details.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately by emailing the project maintainer at [crossban@supportmail.dev](mailto:crossban@supportmail.dev). Do not create a public issue for security vulnerabilities.
