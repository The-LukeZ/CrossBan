# FAQ

## How do I connect servers?

You connect servers by adding their Server ID to the `.env` file and invite the bot to them.

Additional configuration can be done via `/config` commands.



## What is an `.env` file?

An `.env` file is a simple text file used to store configuration settings or environment variables for an application. It contains key-value pairs that specify important information like server IDs, API keys, or database credentials.

This helps keep sensitive information secure and separate from the main application code, making it easier to manage and update configurations.

## How do get the bot online?

The best way to get something online 24/7 is a server.

{% hint style="info" %}
A server costs money - you shouldn't use free hosting solutions, because you don't get a personal IP address which can lead to problems with your bot.

A server doesn't cost that much and I would recommend Venocix - a very reliable hosting solution from Germany.
